The 2nd International Joint Conference on Learning & Reasoning (IJCLR) will be held in Cumberland Lodge, Windsor Great Park, United Kingdom, 28-30 September 2022.

The rapid progress in machine learning has been the primary reason for a fresh look in the transormative potential of AI as a whole during the past decade. A crucial milestone for taking full advantage of this potential is the endowment of algorithms that learn from experience with the ability to consult existing knowledge and reason with what has already been learned. Integrating learning and reasoning constitutes one of the key open questions in AI, and holds the potential of addressing many of the shortcomings of contemporary AI approaches, including the black-box nature and the brittleness of deep learning, and the difficulty to adapt knowledge representation models in the light of new data. Integrating learning and reasoning calls for approaches that combine knowledge representation and machine reasoning techniques with learning algorithms from the fields of neural, statistical and relational learning.

Four international conferences and workshops addressing such research topics join forces in the 2nd International Conference on Learning & Reasoning (IJCLR 2022):

- The 31st International Conference on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) The ILP conference series has been the premier forum for work on logic-based approaches to learning for three decades. Originally focusing on the induction of logic programs, over the years it has expanded its research horizon to other forms of relational learning and to probabilistic approaches.
- The [16th International Workshop on Neural-Symbolic Learning & Reasoning (NeSy)](https://sites.google.com/view/nesy-2022/) The NeSy workshop series is a major venue for the presentation and discussion of key topics related to neural-symbolic computing, i.e. combinations of neural and logic-based approaches to learning & reasoning.
- The 11th International Workshop on Approaches and Applications of Inductive Programming (AAIP) The AAIP workshop series focuses on learning executable programs in arbitrary programming languages, from incomplete specifications. e.g. from examples of their input/output behaviour.
- The 3rd International Workshop on Human-Like Computing (HLC) HLC research aims to endow machines with human-like perceptual, reasoning and learning abilities which support collaboration and communication with human beings. The workshop aim is to bring together leading experts in AI and Cognitive Science to investigate areas of fruitful interaction in which human co-operative and communicative skills can be studied and modelled computationally.
